 This project is created for final exam in SoftUni. The idea of the app is that you have youtubers (or infloencer) that registrate his/her chanel in the app , he/she add some information about the chanel like name , category ,subscribers and how much money they want for one 1 sponsorship commercial. On the other hand we have sponsors that registrate their products with budget. Then the sponsor using a search can faind the type of chanels he want (by category) and apply for sponsorship. When the youtube accept the offer the money are transfer between them .
